# Introduction

Plugins are one-click add-ons that can make your meetings more immersive and collaborative. Dyte provides a bunch of inbuilt plugins to choose from, you can also build your own plugins using the [Plugin SDK](../../plugin-sdk/).

The meeting plugins can be accessed from the `meeting.plugins` object, it exposes the following.

| Property | Type | Description                            |
| -------- | ---- | -------------------------------------- |
| active   | List | All plugins that are currently in use. |
| all      | List | All plugins the meeting has access to. |

Each plugin in the list is of type `DytePlugin` which has the following public fields and methods:

```swift
class DytePlugin {
    var id: String
    var name: String
    var description: String
    var picture: String
    var isPrivate: Bool
    var staggered: Bool
    var baseURL: String
    var config: PluginConfig
    var isActive: Bool
    var enabledBy: String?

    func activate()
    func deactivate()
    func getPluginView(): WebView
    func uploadFile(file: DytePluginFile)
    func sendData(eventName: String, data: Any?)
}
```

The `PluginConfig` type consists of the following fields:

```swift
class PluginConfig(
  var accessControl: String = "FULL_ACCESS"
)
```
