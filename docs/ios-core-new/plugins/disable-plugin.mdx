# Functions to disable plugins

Each plugin in `meeting.plugins` object is of type
[`DytePlugin`](./introduction) and exposes the following functions to disable
plugins.

### Remove Plugin View

The `deactivate()` method removes the WebView from the ViewGroup and stops the
communication between the plugin and the core application.

```swift
var plugin = meeting.plugins.get(0)

plugin.deactivate()
```
