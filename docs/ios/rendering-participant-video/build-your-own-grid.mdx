# Custom Grid View

## Introduction

The `GridView` class provided in Dyte's iOS UIKit allows you to create custom grid views to display content in a structured layout. This guide will walk you through the process of understanding, customizing, and utilizing the `GridView` class to create your custom grid views.

## Step 1: Understanding the GridView Class

The `GridView` class is a customizable UIView subclass designed to display a grid of views. It provides properties and methods to manage the arrangement and presentation of child views within the grid.

### Key Components:

- **Properties**:

  - `maxItems`: Maximum number of items the grid can contain.
  - `currentVisibleItem`: Number of items currently visible in the grid.
  - `getChildView`: A closure returning a custom view type for each grid cell.
  - `scrollView`: UIScrollView for enabling scrolling if the grid overflows.
  - `scrollContentView`: UIView containing the actual grid content within the scroll view.
  - `views`: Array holding the child views of the grid.
  - `frames`: Array of CGRects representing the frames of child views.

- **Methods**:
  - `settingFrames(...)`: Set frames for the grid based on parameters such as visible item count and orientation.
  - `prepareForReuse(...)`: Reset or reuse child views.
  - Helper methods for frame calculations and view creation.

### Example Usage:

```swift
// Instantiate GridView
let gridView = GridView<UIView>(maxItems: 9, showingCurrently: 6) {
    return UIView()
}

// Set frames for the grid view
gridView.settingFrames(visibleItemCount: 6, animation: false) { _ in
    // Handle completion if needed
}

// Add gridView to your desired view
view.addSubview(gridView)
```
