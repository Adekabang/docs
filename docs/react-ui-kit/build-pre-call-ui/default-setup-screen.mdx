Dyte provides a default pre-call preview UI, also known as setup screen as part of our UI components.

Previously in the Quickstart example, we used the following component.

```
<DyteMeeting meeting={meeting} showSetupScreen={true} />
```

If you want to break down the above for a custom UI but still want to reuse the default setup screen, use the following component.

```jsx live
function MyMeeting() {
  const { meeting } = useDyteMeeting();
  const roomState = useDyteSelector((m) => m.self.roomState);

  return (
    <div style={{ height: '480px' }}>
      {roomState === 'init' && <DyteSetupScreen meeting={meeting} />}
      {roomState === 'joined' && <center>Custom in-meeting UI</center>}
      {roomState === 'ended' && <center>Custom post-meeting UI</center>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

If you want to build a custom pre-call UI, let's go to the next page to start building one.
