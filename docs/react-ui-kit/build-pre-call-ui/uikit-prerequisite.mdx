# Prerequisite

Before you begin, review and understand the
[Components Basics](/react-ui-kit/basics/components-basics).

The following components are critical for the meeting to function. If you are
not using `DyteMeeting` and customizing the UI, you will need to render the
following components.

### DyteParticipantsAudio

This component is required for audio playback. **You will not be able to hear
audio without this component**.

This component also displays a dialog if the browser throws an auto play error,
requiring user interaction to allow audio to be played.

```jsx
<DyteParticipantsAudio meeting={meeting} />
```

### DyteNotifications

This component is required for receiving notifications. If you don't have this
component, you won't be notified of events like network disconnection or poor
network.

```jsx
<DyteNotifications meeting={meeting} />
```

### DyteDialogManager

A component which handles all dialog elements in a component. This component is required for the following components to work:

- DyteLeaveButton
- DyteSettingsToggle
- DyteBreakoutRoomsToggle
- DyteMuteAllButton

```jsx
<DyteDialogManager meeting={meeting} />
```

These componenets can further be customized to your needs. However, we will not be discussing that in this tutorial to avoid bloating this tutorial.

Now that you are aware of some of the most crucial components, let's go through the default setup screen, that dyte provides, that requires just 1 extra line of code for you to integrate.
